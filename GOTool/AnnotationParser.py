class Annotation(object):
    """Class representing a GO annotation (possibly parsed from an
    annotation file).

    The class has the following attributes (corresponding to the
    columns of a GO annotation file):

    - ``db``: refers to the database from which the identifier
      in the next column (``db_object_id``) is drawn
    - ``db_object_id``: a unique identifier in ``db`` for the
      item being annotated.
    - ``db_object_symbol``: a unique and valid symbol to which
      ``db_object_id`` is matched. Usually a symbol that means
      something to a biologist.
    - ``qualifiers``: a list of flags that modify the interpretation
      of the annotation (e.g., ``NOT``). Note that this is always
      a list, even when no qualifier exists.
    - ``go_id``: the GO identifier for the term attributed to
      ``db_object_id``.
    - ``db_references``: a list of unique identifiers for a single
      source cited as an authority for the attribution of the
      ``go_id`` to the ``db_object_id``. May be a literature or
      a database record.
    - ``evidence_code``: the GO evidence code
    - ``with``: required for some evidence codes. Holds an additional
      identifier for certain evidence codes.
    - ``aspect``: one of ``P`` (biological process), ``F``
      (molecular function) or ``C`` (cellular compartment).
    - ``db_object_name``: name of gene or gene product
    - ``db_object_synonyms``: a gene symbol or some other human-readable text
    - ``db_object_type``: what kind of thing is being annotated.
      This is either gene (``SO:0000704``), transcript (``SO:0000673``),
      protein (``SO:0000358``), ``protein_structure`` or ``complex``.
    - ``taxons``: taxonomic identifiers (at most two, at least 1). This is
      always a list
    - ``date``: date on which the annotation was made
    - ``assigned_by``: the database which made the annotation.
    - ``organism'': The organism in question. This is a modification
      of the original
    code, motivated by the need to annotate the same tree with
    a bunch of organisms
